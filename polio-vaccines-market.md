<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polio Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IPV</li><li>OPV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polio vaccine market is primarily divided into two types: Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV). IPV is administered via injection and provides a strong immune response without risking vaccine-derived polio. It is commonly used in developed countries. OPV, on the other hand, is given orally and is easier to administer, making it ideal for mass immunization campaigns, particularly in developing regions. Both vaccines play crucial roles in global efforts to eradicate polio.</p></p>
