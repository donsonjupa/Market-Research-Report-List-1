<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inherent Fire-resistant Fabrics</li><li>Treated Fire-resistant Fabrics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire-resistant fabrics market comprises two main types: inherent fire-resistant fabrics and treated fire-resistant fabrics. Inherent fire-resistant fabrics are made from fibers that possess natural flame-resistant properties, providing protection without additional treatment. These fabrics typically retain their fire resistance even after multiple washes. In contrast, treated fire-resistant fabrics undergo chemical treatments to enhance their flame-resistant properties. While effective, their performance can diminish over time due to washing or wear. Both types are essential for safety in various industries, including firefighting, military, and industrial applications.</p></p>
