<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transmucosal Drug Delivery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Transdermal Drug Delivery</li><li>Active Transdermal Drug Delivery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transmucosal drug delivery encompasses two main types: passive and active transdermal drug delivery. </p><p>In passive transdermal drug delivery, drugs penetrate the skin through diffusion, relying on concentration gradients and formulation properties. This method is typically slower and depends on skin permeability.</p><p>Conversely, active transdermal drug delivery employs external energy sources, such as iontophoresis or microneedles, to facilitate drug transport across the skin barrier. This approach offers enhanced control over drug absorption rates and improves efficiency for various therapeutic applications.</p></p>
